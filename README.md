Data Analysis and Visualization Report on Netflix Movies Dataset

1. Introduction

This report presents an analysis of the Netflix Movies dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The dataset is explored, cleaned, and visualized to understand the distribution and relationships between features, specifically focusing on release years and handling missing data.

2. Libraries Used

Pandas: For data manipulation and handling.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For calculating the confusion matrix.

NumPy: For handling numerical operations.



3. Data Loading and Basic Information

data = pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\priya\Desktop\netflix dataset\movies.csv')
print(data.head())
print(data.shape)
print(data.info())
print(data.describe())
print(data.isnull().sum())

Explanation:

Data Loading: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file into a DataFrame named data.

Basic Information: The head(), shape, info(), and describe() functions provide a quick overview of the dataset’s structure, data types, and summary statistics.

Missing Values: isnull().sum() counts missing values in each column, helping us identify columns that require cleaning.


Output:

First 5 Rows: Sample data for a quick view of the structure.

Shape: The number of rows and columns in the dataset.

Info: Detailed information about columns, data types, and missing values.

Describe: Summary statistics for numerical columns (mean, min, max, etc.).

Missing Values Summary: Counts of missing values in each column.



4. Data Cleaning - Handling Missing Values

data['ReleaseYear'] = data['ReleaseYear'].fillna(data['ReleaseYear'].mean())

Explanation:

Handling Missing Values: Missing values in the ReleaseYear column are filled with the mean of the column to maintain a complete dataset.

Purpose: Filling missing values allows us to avoid errors during analysis and visualizations that require complete data.


Output:

Modified ReleaseYear: A ReleaseYear column with missing values replaced by the mean, ensuring no gaps in this column.




5. Data Visualization

5.1 Histogram of Release Years

data['ReleaseYear'].hist()
plt.xlabel('Release Year')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Distribution of Release Years')
plt.show()

Explanation:

Histogram: Shows the distribution of movie release years.

Purpose: To visualize how movies are distributed across different years, highlighting trends such as spikes in movie releases during specific periods.


Output:

Histogram: A bar chart showing the frequency of movies released each year.




5.2 Box Plot of Release Years

plt.boxplot(data['ReleaseYear'].dropna())
plt.xlabel('Release Year')
plt.title('Box Plot of Release Years')
plt.show()

Explanation:

Box Plot: Visualizes the spread, quartiles, and any outliers in the ReleaseYear data.

Purpose: To detect the presence of outliers and the overall range of release years.


Output:

Box Plot: A plot showing the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum values of the release years.



5.3 Heatmap of Correlations

numeric_data = data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
correlation_matrix = numeric_data.corr()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', square=True)
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()

Explanation:

Correlation Matrix: A table showing pairwise correlations between numerical columns.

Heatmap: A graphical representation of the correlation matrix, where colors represent the strength of correlations.

Purpose: To examine relationships between numerical features in the dataset, which can help identify features that may affect each other.


Output:

Heatmap: A color-coded matrix showing positive, negative, or no correlations between numerical columns.



5.4 Confusion Matrix (Using Dummy Data)

true_labels = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1])  # Replace with actual labels
predicted_labels = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0])  # Replace with predicted labels

conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(true_labels, predicted_labels)
sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Labels')
plt.ylabel('True Labels')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()

Explanation:

Confusion Matrix: Shows the performance of a classification model by comparing true labels with predicted labels.

Dummy Data: Used here for demonstration. In practice, replace true_labels and predicted_labels with actual classification results.

Purpose: To evaluate model performance by visualizing correctly and incorrectly classified samples.


Output:

Confusion Matrix Heatmap: A matrix showing counts of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative classifications.



6. Summary

This analysis covers key stages of data handling and visualization:

1. Data Loading and Exploration: Initial examination of the dataset’s structure, types, and missing values.


2. Data Cleaning: Replacing missing values in ReleaseYear with the mean to ensure a complete dataset.


3. Visualizations: Histograms, box plots, and heatmaps to reveal patterns, distributions, and relationships among features.


4. Confusion Matrix: An example visualization for classification model evaluation, showing performance metrics.
